## ðŸ§ª Recommendations
Here are 5 recommendations based on the Hospital Emergency Dashboard findings:
1. Improve Response Time: With only ~59% of patients seen within 30 minutes, hospitals should streamline triage processes and increase staff during peak hours (7â€“10 AM, 1â€“4 PM).
2. Target High-Traffic Days: Weekdays show higher patient flow; shift scheduling should reflect this to reduce wait times and burnout.
3. Enhance Admission Criteria: Nearly 50% of patients are not admittedâ€”review and refine referral processes to reduce unnecessary ER visits.
4. Expand General Practice Support: General Practice accounts for the highest referrals; more support in this unit could reduce bottlenecks.
5. Monitor Demographic Trends: Tailor outreach and care programs to major patient groups (e.g., White and African American populations) to ensure equitable service delivery.

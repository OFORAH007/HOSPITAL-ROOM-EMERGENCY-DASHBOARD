## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

The goal is to give healthcare administrators a clear, interactive view of emergency room performance. The dashboard enables quick evaluation of:

- Patient inflow patterns by time and demographics
- Wait time efficiency and performance against targets
- Department referrals and admission outcomes
- Patient satisfaction trends across months

## ðŸ“Œ Insights & Highlights

- **Avg. Wait Time:** ~35 mins over the year; May 2023 saw a drop to 34.4 mins
- **Admission Rate:** 50.04% overall admitted, balanced with non-admitted
- **Departments with Most Referrals:** General Practice (1.8K), Orthopedics (1.0K)
- **Race Distribution:** Majority White (2.6K), followed by African American (2.0K)
- **Time Blocks of Peak Volume:** 07:00â€“10:00 and 13:00â€“16:00 on weekdays
- **Target Compliance:** Only 59.32% of patients were seen within the 30-minute standard

## ðŸ§ª Recommendations
Here are 5 recommendations based on the Hospital Emergency Dashboard findings:
1. Improve Response Time: With only ~59% of patients seen within 30 minutes, hospitals should streamline triage processes and increase staff during peak hours (7â€“10 AM, 1â€“4 PM).
2. Target High-Traffic Days: Weekdays show higher patient flow; shift scheduling should reflect this to reduce wait times and burnout.
3. Enhance Admission Criteria: Nearly 50% of patients are not admittedâ€”review and refine referral processes to reduce unnecessary ER visits.
4. Expand General Practice Support: General Practice accounts for the highest referrals; more support in this unit could reduce bottlenecks.
5. Monitor Demographic Trends: Tailor outreach and care programs to major patient groups (e.g., White and African American populations) to ensure equitable service delivery.
